To add all the changes you've made:
git add .

To commit them:
git commit -m "MY MESSAGE HERE" #-m is the message flag

You can put those steps together like this:
git commit -a -m "MY MESSAGE HERE"

To push your committed changes from your local repository to your remote repository:
git push origin master

git commit -a -m "index 1 aanpepast"


git pull origin master
fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master branch),
and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out.

git pull only
works if the branch you have checked out is tracking an upstream branch.
For example, if the branch you have checked out tracks origin/master, git pull is equivalent to git pull origin master

SASS DOCUMENTATION
=======================

Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

* If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
  primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

* If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
  sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

* For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
  https://sass-lang.com/blog/posts/7828841
